# COM-port-web-simulator

A browser-based simulation of a COM (serial) port, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter basic commands like LED ON, FAN OFF, or STATUS, and see instant mock responses — similar to how real devices communicate over a serial port.

**What It Does:**

Simulates basic serial port-style communication
Lets users type simple commands and view fake hardware-style responses
Built entirely in the browser — no backend or Python required
Includes a multi-page layout with a clean, beginner-friendly UI

**Why I Made This:**

I created this project to apply my frontend development skills to a concept usually done in hardware. The idea was to simulate basic serial port behavior in a simple web environment using only core web technologies. Everything was written and tested directly on GitHub using github.dev, and it's deployed using GitHub Pages.

**Files Overview:**

index.html – Landing page with project intro and navigation
style.css – Handles layout, colors, fonts, and UI styling
simulator.html – Main simulator interface where commands are entered
script.js – JavaScript logic for handling input and generating responses
README.md – Project documentation (this file)
